# MIT Media Lab - Computational Law

## Law ReImagined-
## Inventing Automated and Autonomous Legal Entities Part 4 (Preparation Stage)

### "AALE" Collaborative Hack with Dazza, Beth, Brenden, Bryan, Silke et al. 

### Preparing next AALE 4th Session-
### CWP (Current Working Process) and method so far to tackle AALE vs Contract Law questions

#### Content largely derived from Dazza's CIVICS post dated August 8th 2019: 
#### “Creating a Legal Framework for Autonomous Agents and Automated Transactions” 
#### (https://civics.com/2019/08/08/creating-a-legal-framework-for-autonomous-agents-and-automated-transactions/)

#### And furthermore using the legal codification of the body of Contract Law provided by the 2nd Restatement
#### (https://github.com/mitmedialab/AutomatedLegalEntityChallenge/blob/master/docs/20190812-Body-of-Contract-Law-2nd-Restatement.md),
#### to carry out an AALE/DAOs relevant legal analysis. 
#### The aim is to surface a few more design requirements and legal engineering success metrics.
