INSERT CB CC MENTION

With its efficient, cost-conscious, productivity & performance streamlining oriented approach, this SALI-LMSS draft tool should be quite attractive for professionals and senior decision makers. Also for its well explained, intuitive ease of use and clear-cut BPM approach, in the context of practicing Law and/or providing alternative Legal services, it has our vote.

No mind-stretching decentralized thinking, yet, there we're talking about BPM that is usable, now, within the still dominant paper paradigm of a heavily structured, old-fashioned legal profession. 

While SALI-LMSS attributes (tree-based structured, hierarchical, objects and parameters based) may not sound too earth-shattering (one could argue on reality-reduction by hierarchy, parameters, and language), they hold a clear advantage of functioning in an intelligible, digestible and palastable way, so that we can start working on training wheels and build up complexity from there. 

We won't speculate whether SALI-LMSS tool will ultimately nail the standard, or even if there should and will be "a" standard (there is probably such a need, though), but to us it sounds like a move in "a" (if not "the") right direction. Furthermore, we are intrigued by SALI-LMSS'possible relevance and usability for our AALE challenge: we like what this draft tool does, and because it could do even more with some flexible and modular extensions, having been conceived with that mindset.

In [Part A](), we look at the relevance and usability of SALI-LMSS draft tool for our AALE Computational Law Challenge.

In [Part B - SALI Legal Matter Standard Update Presentation (June 2018)](),  we review the June 2018 high level outlook of the draft tool, that was initially conceived in 2017.

#

The SALI Alliance is an independent organization of law firms, companies, solution providers, industry organizations
and academics focused on developing open, practical standards for the legal industry.

### SALI stakeholders represent all parts of the legal industry: 
- Legal services buyers (companies)
- Legal services providers (law firms and alternatives)
- Association and academics
- Technology and solution providers

### Goals for the matter profiling legal standard:
- **Open:** free and available to all stakeholders
- **Industry-driven:** managed by an independent non-profit industry organization
- **Hierarchical:** will have multiple layers of specificity and structure
- **Extensible:** defined way to extend codes to meet the proprietary needs of stakeholders
- **Practical:** will come with associated sample implementations of user interfaces,
and Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)

### The Legal Matter Specification (LMS) standard seeks to provide a common vocabulary across legal operations to improve our processes and efficiency

### LMS Mission: building “SKUs” for legal services ("SKU" = Stock Keeping Units)

#

_**WHY IS THIS SO HARD?**_

### TIME INVARIANCE
#### For a LMS to be practical, it needs to identify a matter in a constant manner as it evolves with minimal disruption to existing systems that are depending up on the data
#### The legal matter specification must be able to describe the matter through its lifecycle: as the legal matter progresses, we need to describe it in a way that does not invalidate the previous descriptions
#### Different uses of the data must identify matters consistently over time:
- --> Marketing: What experience does your law firm/department have in providing these services?
- --> Matter Staffing: Which time-keepers have the expertise we need?
- --> Pricing: What are the budgets and potential pricing options / costs for the requested services?
- --> Project Management: Is the matter appropriately staffed? Is the matter on budget?

#

_**WHY IS THIS SO HARD?**_

### VIEWER INVARIANCE
#### No matter which party is describing the matter, it should be coded consistently using **viewer-independent descriptors:**
- --> DON'T: Client / Adverse Party 
- --> DO: Plaintiff / Defendant 
- --> DO: Lessor / Lessee
- --> DO: Licensor / Licensee
#### Maintain constancy through viewer independent descriptors (GPS analogy: say turn West, don't say turn Left, etc.)

#

### What the LMS Standard is delivering?
1. A standard structure to describe a matter <-- **Structure** 
>_**Structure Browser: https://salilegal.org/sali3/structure2.php**_

2. A standard vocabulary to describe a matter <-- **Codes** 
>_**Code Browser: https://salilegal.org/sali3/browser.php**_

3. A standard set of tools to assist the above <-- **APIs**

### The LMS structure defines where information is stored

![SALI-LMSS interactive tree](https://github.com/CryptosOdysseus/AALE-Contributions/blob/master/Image-of-SALI-LMSS-Structure-Collapsible-Interactive-Tree.png)

### The LMS code sets define what are allowable values
- The SALI LMS Standard builds upon several international standards 
- The LMS Code browser shows allowable codes defining our common vocabulary 

### The LMS APIs are tools to help implement the standard

#### API /// Purpose

**Instance**

• Helps create conforming matters
• Validates matter structures
• Supports user-defined extensions
• Supports default values/templates

**Query** 

• Provide a protocol for requesting information and returning results

**UI/Synch**

• Supports applications in getting the latest version of the standard, new codes, etc.

# Body of Draft Legal Matter Specification Standard (LMSS) 1.0, Rev 2 (June 2019)

#

## 1 Overview

_**The SALI Legal Matter Specification Standard (LMSS) was developed by the Standards for the Advancement of the Legal Industry (SALI) Alliance to provide a standard way for parties to specify, describe and exchange information describing legal services at the matter level throughout a legal matter’s lifecycle. The SALI LMSS is designed to function as a worldwide legal matter standard.**_

### 1.1 What do we mean by a “legal matter”?

For the purpose of the LMSS, a Legal Matter is considered to be any group of activities for the purposes of delivering a legal service to one or more parties. The activities are either a major project with start and end point (e.g. litigation, acquisition of a business, a regulatory filing, etc.) or a grouping of micro projects (e.g. advice).

### 1.2 What do we mean by the “legal matter lifecycle”?

The legal matter lifecycle means the description of the matter from its conception as a request for services through its inception and execution through closing. Because the LMSS must support a matter that will evolve through its lifecycle, it is designed accommodate the evolution of the matter without jeopardizing the integrity of systems that are depending on data provided at an earlier stage of the matter.

### 1.3 What are the components of the LMSS?

The SALI LMSS has following components:

- The legal matter specification includes: structure, allowed values, and dependencies and supports both matter instances (the description of specific matters), and matter templates (the description of classes of matters).

- The legal matter application programming interfaces (APIs) include: the transport API for exchanging data and the UX API for supporting the user interface of applications that use the standard.

#

## 2 Design Principles

_**The SALI LMSS was designed using the following principles:**_

### 2.1 Player/Viewer independence

The standard is designed to provide clear guidance and party-independent enumerated values to ensure that matters are encoded the same way independent of the party involved in matter. As an example, the standard supports terms such as “plaintiff” and
“defendant” which have the same meaning no matter who is looking at the matter over terms like “client” and “opposing party” which change depending upon a player’s role in the matter.

### 2.2 Successive refinement and additive coding

Because the LMSS is intended to be used legal matters to describe legal matters that are being executed, the standard implements hierarchical and additive coding. As an example, when a matter begins, the area of law for a matter may not yet be fully determined, for example, we may know that it is a environmental matter, but not what specialty in environmental law. Such a matter would initially be encoded as environmental – ENVT. At a later point it may be determined that the matter is an air quality matter -- AIRQ. This would be encoded as "ENVT-AIRQ" The successive code is added to the previous code and is a further refinement of the previous code. This design ensure that other systems that depend upon the initial restructuring code continue to work.

Furthermore, each code in a code set is guaranteed to be unique, and each code is guaranteed to have a single parent code. This means that if you simply use the code "AIRQ", the full coding path "ENVT-AIRQ" can be derived. In cases where the SALI
standard has adopted codes from other standards that don’t adhere to this requirement, the "+" notation is used. For example both US, California and El Salvador, Cardenas use the same ISO code "CA". To distinguish these, the code is prepended with the
parent code followed by a "+". USA ("US"), California ("CA") is coded as "US+CA"; El Salvador ("SV"), Cardenas ("CA") is coded as "CV+CA".

### 2.3 Standards based

The LMSS is built on and incorporates existing international standards in addition to specifying new codes applicable to the legal services domain.

### 2.4 Extensible

Since the LMSS cannot anticipate all needs, there is a well-defined way to extend the standard while staying within the design and API functionality. There is a methodology for providing including private structural components and private allowable values that at some point may be submitted and considered for incorporation into to future versions of the LMSS.

### 2.5 Agile approach

The LMSS is designed using an agile approach wherein the proposed standard drafts are revised and tested by a broad group of stakeholders representing law firms, clients and solution providers to ensure that the standard is practical and appropriate to the specific needs and use cases being addressed.

The process is as follows is described in the table below:

|Name | Description | Comment |
|-----|-------------|---------|
|Draft LMSS 1.0 Rev. 1 | First draft revision 1 of the LMSS 1.0 specification | The first version always had the word "Draft" and "Rev. <#>" in its title.|
|Draft LMSS 1.0 Rev <n> | Nth draft revision 1 of the LMSS 1.0 specification | For each successive draft, the revision number is incremented.|
|LMMS 1.0 | Final version of the LMSS 1.0 standard | "Draft" and "Rev. <#>" are removed from the title once the standard is adopted by SALI Alliance members.|
|Draft LMSS 2.0 Rev 1 | First draft revision 1 of the LMSS 2.0 specification | Successive versions of the standard will increment LMSS number.|

## 3 Legal Matter Specification (LMSS) Components

The legal matter specification includes the following components:

- structure,
- allowed values,
- dependencies, and,
- extensions.

In addition, the LMSS supports both:

- matter instances (the description of specific matters), and
- matter templates (the description of classes of matters).

### 3.1 LMSS Structure

The LMSS Structure specifies where descriptive elements of matter are stored and how those elements relate to each other. The structure is comprised of components called “containers.” Containers can be thought of as tables in a relational database. The
structure defines structure of each container – its elements – how containers relate to each other, which elements are required and which are optional, and whether the relationship between containers are one-to-one or one-to-many.

The LMSS structure can be expressed as a database schema for storage or an XML or JSON structure for transmission of the matter information.

### 3.2 LMSS Allowed Values

The LMSS Allowed Values specify the type of information that may be stored in different elements of the containers. Allowed values fall into the following categories:

#### 3.2.1 Enumerated Values

Enumerated values are specifically defined values that are allowed at permitted as values of specific container elements.

The LMSS relies extensively on enumerated values to ensure that common definitions across systems and languages. Some standards are officially incorporated in the standard such as ISO-4217, which provides standard codes standard names codes for
currencies. Enumerated values components are summarized in the table below

_**Enumerated value components**_

| Type | Characters | Explanation |
|------|------------|-------------|
| **Code Set** | Text(40) | The name of the code set |
| **Code** | Up to 16 | A code for the value. |
| **Parent Code** | Text(250) | The code of the of the parent in a hierarchical coding system. This is null for top level codes.|
| **Short Name** | Up to 40 | The name of the value intended for use in user interfaces and other applications with limited space.|
| **Name** | Up to 100 | The full name of the value.|
| **Description** | Up to 4000 | A description of the value.|
| **Tags** | Up to 10 | Synonyms or common usage. Tags are used to enhance search.|
| **URL** | Text(250) | Optional URL used as a reference.|

>- Codes are alphanumeric characters excluding the ‘-‘ character. They are case insensitive. Codes are typically stored in Text(250) fields because codes may be additive. Separate code may be appended to each other using the “-“ character as a separator. The 16 character limit does not include extension prefixes.
>
>- Codes are of the form: (@[A-Z0-9]+:)?([A-Z0-9.]+ | [A-Z0-9.]+[+][A-Z0-9.]+)
>
>- '+' has a special meaning to support non-conforming code sets.

Enumerated value codes are combine by adding a "-" (dash character) and the next most specific code as a suffix.

Examples:

| Code | Concatenated Code | Short Name |
|------|-------------------|------------|
| NAM | NAM | North America |
| US | NA-US | United States |
| US+CA | NA-US-US+CA | California |

#### 3.2.2 Text Values

Text values are unstructured natural language descriptions intended to be human readable and informative. Text values are also used to store information not yet specified by the standard. Text values are intended to be searchable, and subject to standard text operations.

#### 3.2.3 Numeric Values

Numeric values store scalar numeric information. Numeric values are subject to common mathematical operations. Numeric values can be floating point, whole number and boolean.

### 3.3 Dependencies

Dependencies restrict which structural components and which allowed values may appear in a valid matter instance based on other values in the matter. As an example, if a process is of type “transaction,” the players in that transaction may not be of the type “plaintiff” or “defendant.” These values are restricted to process of type “dispute.”

> Remark: Dependencies are not part of Draft LMSS 1.0 Rev 2.

### 3.4 LMSS Encodings

The LMSS can be encoded machine readable formats. JSON is the baseline supported format.

Machine Readable JSON

```

{
    "document" : {
        "header" : {
            "lmss version" : "1.02" //Draft LMSS 1.0 Rev 2
            ,"lmss type" : "INST" //Instance
            ,"language" : "en-us"
            ,"charset" : "UTF-8"
        }
        ,"matter" : {
            "title" : "Wage and hour class action against XYZ Corp."
            ,"locale" : "NAM-US-US+NY" //New York
            ,"process" : {
                "title" : "Wage and hour class action against XYZ Corp."
                ,"process type" : "D-CCI" //Court Proceeding, Civil
                ,"area of law" : "LEMP-WGHR" //Wage and Hour Law
                ,"player" : [{
                    "name" : "Jane Smith and co-workers"
                    ,"player role" : "PLTF" //Plaintiff
                    ,"legal entity" : "GROUP-CLASS" //Class of Plaintiffs
                }
                ,{
                    "name" : "XYZ Corporation, Inc."
                    ,"player role" : "DEFT" //Defendant
                    ,"legal entity" : "ENTITY-CORP" //Corporation
                    ,"industry" : "TEC" //Technology
                }]
            }
        }
    }
}

```

#

### 3.5 Extensions to the LMSS Codes

The LMSS is intended to be adaptable to the needs of customers. It is our intent that later versions of the standard will incorporate extensions that have been developed.

The LMSS has a well-defined way to extend enumerated codes.

Codes are extended by:

- Defining an extension prefix of the format "@<alphanumeric(6)>". This prefix followed by a colon (":") will be used as a prefix to any extended codes.

- Creating and extension code table that conforms to the specification in section 3.2.1.

- Embedding the extension table or a reference to it in the header.

#### 3.5.1 Extension Example

Law firm AM would like to extend the SALI industry codes to include subcategories of real estate. In this example the "Real Estate" industry type with code "RES" will be extended by adding subtypes of real estate below it.

The prefix code chosen is "@am". This prefix is chosen arbitrarily, but in planned versions of the API, extension keys and be registered and stored to facilitate data exchange.)

The extension table would have this the following data.

|Code | Set Code | Parent Code | Full Code Name |
|-----|----------|-------------|----------------|
| SALI Industries | MULFAM | RES | RES-@am:MULFAM | Multi-Family Residential |
| SALI Industries | OFFICE | RES | RES-@am:OFFICE | Office |
| SALI Industries | INDUST | RES | RES-@am:INDUST | Industrial |
| SALI Industries | RESIDL | RES | RES-@am:RESIDL | Residential |
| SALI Industries | MIXUSE | RES | RES-@am:MIXUSE | Mixed-Use |
| SALI Industries | RETAIL | RES | RES-@am:RETAIL | Retail | 
| SALI Industries | DATCTR | RES | RES-@am:DATCTR | Data Center |

_**The following show and example of how the code would appear in an LMSS Structure:**_

```

"player": [{
        "name": "ZZZ Corporation, Inc",
        "legal-entity": "ENTITY-CORP",
        "industry": "RES-@AM:OFFICE" //Real Estate - Office
        }]
 
 ```

#

## 4 Structure of LMSS Document

### 4.1 Overview

The LMSS document is comprised of a Header and one or more Matters. 

The Header and the Matter(s) are containers Each container has elements that may be of type Text, Numeric, Enumeration or Container. 

Enumerations are stored in Text(250) fields to accommodate multiple levels of specificity that are represented as concatenated codes.

Containers are pointers to other structures.

A well-formed Document is a structure that includes all required fields. (Note that the concept of a well-formed document applies to instance but not templates or queries.) 

In the tables below, “REQ” indicates whether the element is required (in an LMSS instance but not a query), “MULT” indicates whether multiple values are permitted. 

A well-formed document is required in the interchange of instances of matters between systems. 

A well-formed document is not required when the LMSS is used in a query. In those instances, a missing field matches all instances. See LMSS Queries below.

### 4.2 Document

The Document container is the top-level container in the LMSS instance. The Document must have a Header and one or more Matters.

Document container elements:

| ELEMENT | REQ | MULT. | TYPE | COMMENTS |
|---------|-----|-------|------|----------|
| Header | Y | N | Container | The header information for the document. |
| Matter | Y | Y | Container | The matters included in the document. |

### 4.3 Document Header

The LMSS document header is describes the version, type, default language and character set needed to for correctly read the LMSS document.

|ELEMENT | REQ | MULT. | TYPE | COMMENTS |
|--------|-----|-------|------|----------|
|Title | N | N | Text(250) | An optional title for the document. |
| Version | Y | N | Float | The version of the LMSS standard being encoded. |
| Type | Y | N | Enumeration: SALI LMSS Type | The type of the document. Supported types include "Instance", "Template", and "Query". The default value is "Instance". |
| Language | N | N | Enumeration: IETF BCP 47 | Languages follow the Internet Engineering Task Force recommendation in BCP 47. |
| Charset | N | N | Text | Default value is UTF-8. |
| Extension Link | N | Y | Text: URI | A link to an extension file. |
| Extension | N | Y | Container | One or more extension definitions. |
| Declaration | N | Y | Container | Declarations are indexes of names that need to be cross referenced in a specification. NameIDs can be used in place of names wherever names may appear. |

#### 4.3.1 Title

An optional title for the document.

#### 4.3.2 Version

The LMSS version is defined and maintained by SALI. Published version of the
standard may be found at Sali.org

#### 4.3.3 Type

Type refers to the type of the Document. Permissible values include:

- Instance – An instance encodes a specific matter. Instances have required containers and elements to be well formed.
- Template – A template encodes default settings of an instance. Parts of templates that are not specified are assumed to accept all values. Templates must adhere to the LMSS container structure, however required elements are relaxed.
- Query – A query encodes a database query following a SQL-like structure. Queries have select, where, order by and limit structures.

#### 4.3.4 Language

Language declares the default language of the LMSS structure. Languages follow the
Internet Engineering Task Force recommendation in BCP 47.

#### 4.3.5 Charset

The charset describes the encoding of the characters in the LMSS document. The
default encoding is UTF-8.

#### 4.3.6 Extension Link

A link to an extension file that conforms to the LMSS Extension file format.

### 4.4 Extension

An extension container is an in-document definition of an extension. A document may include an array of these in the header.

The scope applies to the document.

| ELEMENT | REQ. | MULT. | TYPE | COMMENTS |
|---------|------|-------|------|----------|
| Code Set | Y | N | Text(40) | The code of the code set being extended. |
| Code | Y | N | Text(40) | The extension code. | Must be unique in the namespace. |
| Parent | Y | N | Text(40) | The parent code. | This code must be defined before this definition. |
| Name | Y | N | Text(250) | The short name of the extended code. |

A sample in-document extension is shown below:

```

{
    "document" : {
        "header" : {
            "lmss version" : "1.02" //Draft LMSS 1.0 Rev 2
            ,"lmss type" : "INST" //Instance
            ,"language" : "en-us"
            ,"charset" : "UTF-8"
            ,"extension" : [{
                "code set" : "SALI-IND"
                ,"code" : "@MULFAM"
                ,"parent" : "RES"

#

#### 4.4.1 Code Set

The LMSS Code of the code set. (See 6.1)

#### 4.4.2 Code

The code assigned to the extension. The code will have a "@" prepended to it when used.

#### 4.4.3 Parent

The parent code. The parent code must be an existing standard code in the code set, or a previously defined extension. Examples include "RES" or "@OFFICE".

#### 4.4.4 Name

The short name of extension code.

### 4.5 Declaration

A declaration may be used to assign and index to an item to ensure accurate cross referencing. Declarations are typically used for legal entities but can be used in place of a Name (See 4.10.1, 4.11.1 and 4.11.2).

A legal person or entity is any human or non-human entity, in other words, any human being, firm, or government agency that is recognized as having privileges and obligations, such as having the ability to enter into contracts, to sue, and to be sued.

Entities are used to maintain referential integrity across LMSS structure. For example, if the matter includes two processes that refer to the same legal entity as in the example, "Review and negotiate project labor agreement for Jane Smith." 

The matter may be encoded to have two processes – one for review and another of negotiation. But the review and negotiation are the same legal entity. An entity declaration should be used in this instance and the entity NameID should be used in each process to ensure that it is understood that the objects of both process are the same.

| ELEMENT | REQ. | MULT. | TYPE | COMMENTS |
|---------|------|-------|------|----------|
| NameID | Y | N | Text(40) | The NameID of the entity. | Must be of the regular expression form \^[A-Za-z0-9_-]{1,39} |
| Name | Y | N | Text(250) | Name to be inserted wherever the NameID appears. |

#### 4.5.1 NameID

The ID to be used in place of a name. NameIDs must begin with a caret symbol. (e.g. ^102 or ^EntityXYZ).

#### 4.5.2 Name

The name to be used in place of the NameID.

### 4.6 Matter

The Matter container encapsulates the information for a matter. There may be more than one matter per document. The matter must have a title, a human readable description, a locale and one or more processes. The locale may restrict the types of
the processes. For example, certain bankruptcy processes are limited to the US because those processes a defined by US Bankruptcy law.

Matter container elements:

|ELEMENT | REQ | MULT. | TYPE | COMMENTS |
|--------|-----|-------|------|----------|
| Title | Y | N | Text(250) | The title of the matter. |
| Locale | Y | N | Enumeration: ISO 3166-2 | The location of the matter. |

| Narrative | Y | N | Container | The description of the matter. |

#### 4.6.1 Title

A required title for the process.

#### 4.6.2 Locale

A required locale for the matter. The locale is an enumeration.

### 4.7 Narrative

A narrative holds a group of related matter descriptions. It includes a required type which is an enumerated list, an optional usage tag, and an optional source. 

Each narrative can have a specified usage so a Matter can have multiple narratives based on the audience. each narrative is intended to capture a logically unique matter interpretation of the matter. 

Formatting and language variants are accommodated in the description container.

Narrative container elements:

| ELEMENT | REQ. | MULT. | TYPE | COMMENTS |
|---------|------|-------|------|----------|
|Type | Y | N | Enumeration: SALI Narrative Type | The type of the narrative. |
| Usage | N | N | Text(250) | Descriptions of the intended audience or other usage of the narrative. |

#### 4.7.1 Type

The narrative type is an enumerated list intended to capture the sensitivity of the narrative. Values include: public, confidential, private, generic, etc.

#### 4.7.2 Usage

Usage is an optional human readable field that should capture the audience or usage of the narrative. Examples for the same matter might be: "Narrative written for pitches to lenders," "Narrative written for pitches to borrowers," and "Narrative written for generic finance pitches."

#### 4.7.3 Source

The source is an optional element that describe the source of the narrative. You may provide multiple sources. Examples include: "2015 litigation department compensation memo," and "2017 environmental practice Chambers submission."

### 4.8 Description

The description in an container encapsulates the specific text of a specific narrative. The description has text, a format and a language. If the language is not specified, it is inherited from the matter. For example, if a firm keeps French and English versions of the same narrative, or plain text and HTML formatted versions of the same narrative, these would be accommodated in the description container.

| ELEMENT | REQ. | MULT. | TYPE | COMMENTS |
|---------|------|-------|------|----------|
| Text | Y | N | Text(4000) | The description of the matter. |

#### 4.8.2 Format

Two formats are supported: Text and HTML.

#### 4.8.3 Language

### 4.9 Process

The Process container describes the process, service or product being delivered.

Every process must have a single process type. Top-level process types are transactions, disputes, regulatory proceedings, bankruptcy/restructurings, and advisory.

If we think of the process as a sentence, the process type reprints the “verb.” They
describe the action that is being taken.

The players are the legal entities involved in the process. These should be thought of the subject (Joe Smith) and object (Company X) in the sentence “Joe Smith sued Company X for $500,000 for breach of contract.”

The process predicate contains the predecessors or outcomes of the process. In the sentence above, “for $500,000” and “for breach of contract.”

The Area of Law provides context to the process. The area of law should be thought of the primary subject of law for the process — think the class that’s the attorney was in when she learned about the applicable law. The area of law is provided primarily for context as in the examples, “He prosecuted the defendant” and “She prosecuted the patent.” The first is criminal law, the second is intellectual property law.

Process container elements:

#### 4.9.4 Area of Law

The Area of Law is a SALI enumerated value that provides context to the process. The area of law should be thought of the primary subject of law for the process — think the class that’s the attorney was in when she learned about the applicable law. 

The area of law is provided primarily for context as in the examples, “He prosecuted the defendant” and “She prosecuted the patent.” The first is criminal law, the second is intellectual property law. There can be multiple areas of law.

## 5 The Legal Matter Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)

LMSS APIs are not supported in Draft LMSS 1.0 Rev 2.

The LMSS supports several types of APIs:

- LMSS Instance
- LMSS Queries
- LMSS UI/Sych API

### 5.1 LMSS Instance

The Instance API is used to create, import and export matters. It also supports default values and user-defined extensions.

- Helps create conforming matters
- Validates matter structures
- Supports user-defined extensions
- Supports default values/templates

### 5.2 LMSS Queries

An important part of the LMSS is to support the querying of data stores against different criteria. The standard leverages the LMSS definition — structure, enumerated values, text and numeric values — to specify search criteria. In these instances sparse version of the LMSS are applied to develop search criteria.

#### 5.2.1 LMSS Query WHERE Clauses

In the standard SQL queries clauses SELECT, WHERE, and ORDER BY, the LMSS template can be used to define the WHERE clauses.

For enumerated values that are filled in, the search uses the “starts with” criteria for specifying a search. For text and numeric fields, you can apply standard SQL wildcard matching.

Below are several examples of how this applied, using LMSS Templates in Queries:

QUERY STRUCTURE 

- Select all matters WHERE lease transactions are in New York State:

```

{
    "document" : {
        "header" : {
            "lmss version" : "1.02" //Draft LMSS 1.0 Rev 2
            ,"lmss type" : "QRY" //Query
            ,"language" : "en-us"
            ,"charset" : "UTF-8"
        }
        ,"matter" : {
            "locale" : "NAM-US-US+NY" //New York
            ,"process" : {
                "process type" : "T-LEA" //Lease
            }
        }
    }
}

```

                "area of law" : "LEMP" //Labor and Employment Law
                ,"player" : [{
                    "name" : "Wells Fargo%"
                    ,"player role" : "DEFT" //Defendant

                ,{
                    "player role" : "PLTF" //Plaintiff

            ,"language" : "en-us"
            ,"charset" : "UTF-8"
        }
        ,"matter" : {
            "process" : {
                "process type" : "R-ENF" //Enforcement
