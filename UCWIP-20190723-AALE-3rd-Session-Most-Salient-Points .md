# UCWIP - Under Construction - Work In Progress

#
# NOTE: Brenden has included important point that weren't talked (much) during Live Session but wre tackled off-the-record in preparatory sessions. Make sure to include these in both SALIENT POINTS and full TAKEAWAY.


#

#### -A- Suggestion for better process by Bryan

##### Approved & being implemented (including this data migration to Github).




##### Furthermore, bearing in mind some of the ulterior motives are educational, and also advising senior decision makers in various settings, it’s important to keep it all intelligible, digestible & palatable.

#

#### -B- Engagement with customer and laying the ground to establish a lawyer-client relationship by first making sure the user better understands ther legal analysis approach.

While none of this is Legal Advice, nor may be construed as (an attempt at) Legal Practice, the ones in a position to expect from this some form of usefulness & utility include user Publishing DAO: user is in a position to assess the usability of this work when user can complete their Business & Technological polyvalent setup with a legal-analysis-oriented approach. 

There is a difference between Technological and Legal definitions of Roles and Relationships, and therefore legal assessment of Rights and Responsibilities (R4). For ex., depending on context, user Publishing DAO can be an Agent (of a writer acting as Principal) or Publishing DAO can be a Principal, with logistics company acting as Agent. This has severe enough legal & liability consequences to pay attention to. 

It also suggests that when Agency Law isnt sufficient to tackle most of the scenarios, it becomes necessary to switch to Contract Law (and Tort etc.) which implies to build a series of disclaimers in order to shield the Publishing DAO from basic legal harm that can be dodged. The nature of the legal structure behind the legal persons involved, and the degree of automation & autonomy also affect the lawyer-client relationship etsbalishment, process & procedures.

#

#### -C- Start with simplified use cases and build a primary foundation – then build up complexity. 

Freeze patterns of possible scenarios that happen, then determone R4 and proceed to legal analysis under a type of Law.

#

#### -D- Taming the troika of complexity, granularity, and guaranteed rabbit holes.

Here we use certain selective methods to tame the troika of complexity, granularity, and guaranteed rabbit holes, while not losing sight of the larger picture, and ultimate usefulness & utility of this work & project, starting with convergence toward defining a B/L/T/ mechanism design.

#

#### -E- (Re-)Statement of objectives

##

##### -E-1: Pre-Fall objectives (Working Topics as laid out by Dazza in GitHub)

##

##### -E-2: AALE/DAO engineered for self-compliance among members and vis-à-vis external parties

##

##### -E-3: "Three-Bees" Functions & Legal Objects

#

#### -F- A Question of Method(s) in Legal Analysis

##

##### -F-1: Apply several legal frameworks & define R4 (Roles & Relationships, Rights & Responsibilities)

##

##### -F-2: Merits of Agency Law framework

Including when to realize that an Agency Law analysis does NOT apply: 

ClickThrough Agreement DAO:Agency “We are not your agent if we do nothing”.

No action or agency relationship: it is extremely important that users understand there is no agency relationship if something is put forth as a vote, because if it is NOT accepted by the (Publishing) DAO, the (Publishing) DAO should be able to drop it as it is non-binding and not executable under an Agency Law relationship. More like a Contract Law relationship then.

##

##### -F-3: Merits of Contract Law framework (+ some Tort Law maybe)

Agency Law vs. Contract law: Contract law disclaimers for functions(Bryan and Silke)

Much can be done with Contract Law, the question is if things fall through the cracks how does agency law catch that.

##

##### -F-4: Dichotomy between traditional set-up & AALE/DAO in relation with Legal Structures

##

##### -F-5: "Three-Bees" Functions and Legal Objects that are required to build up frameworks toward objectives

##

##### -F-6: Guaranteed Rabbit Hole 1- capped & to be tackled later: differences between jurisdictions

(What are the rights and responsibilities of an espresso book machine in different jurisdictions.)

Ultimately mapping Law & different kinds of law: Agency law, Contract law, Tort Law, Securities Law.

##

##### -F-7: Guaranteed Rabbit Hole 2- capped & to be tackled later: code, free speech, and liability

Code executed can be evil but code not executed is just text per se. Then comes the chain of events & liabilities.

#

#### -G- Other important points requiring further digging  

##

##### G-1 Fault Tolerance

**Fault Tolerance:** if the output (of a transaction) is gibberish, how do you account for that.

**Fault Tolerance:** there can also be timing issues and financing issues where you can’t roll things backwards.

##

##### G-2 Computational Law outcomes 

Need to collect DAO or Computational systems features that have legal consequence for outcomes in different kinds of law-

E.G.

1. Autonomous process versus human in the loop

2. Reputation bounty

3. Token manager versus voting machine

##

##### G-3 Bonding Curve

The bonding curve has different roles and responsibilities and actors at different points along the curve.

##

##### G-4 Staking

If many different kinds of staking- what could go wrong.

##

##### G-5 Voting

Voting without knowledge of wrongdoing- what are the implications under which Law.
