# BRENDEN POINTS

Hi Chris,

Sorry I’ve been out traveling a bit...

We’re going to have a planning meeting on Friday.   7:00 PM Berlin, Germany (GMT+2)

I’d like to get 2-5 sentences, phrases whatever- of what the salient points you got out at the last live meeting...

A small mini interactive exchange With me as also helpful....

We are trying to plan The next format and agenda for the next meeting.

If you didn’t directly participate this still might be helpful for you-

These are some of the salient points for me-

Fault Tolerance
If the output (of a transaction) is gibberish 
How do you account for that....
There can also be timing issues and financing issues where you can’t roll things backwards.

Computational Legal Outcomes
We need to collect DAO or Computational systems features that have legal consequence for outcomes in different kinds of law-

E.G.
1. Autonomous process versus human in the loop

2. Reputation bounty

3. Token manager versus voting machine


Principal roles and context 
name of the role is important 
The principal can have many rolls in different context

Bonding Curve
The bonding curve has different roles and responsibilities and actors  at different points along the curve

Jurisdictions
What are the rights and responsibilities of an espresso machine in different jurisdictions.

legal persons vs legal personality:
A circle representation is a legal person....
So there is a necessity to be able to mark things as legal persons v.s. legal personality- which can be the form of a corporation or a LLC vs a Lawyer relationship.


ClickThrough Agreement DAO:Agency
“We are not your agent if we do nothing”
No action or agency relationship.
It’s extremely important that users understand there is no agency relationship if something is put forth as a vote because if it is NOT excepted by the DAO. The DAO should be able to drop it as it is non-binding and not an agency relationship.


Agency Law vs. Contract law Contract law disclaimers for functions
(Bryan and Silke)
Much can be done with contract law the question is if things fall through the cracks how does agency law catch that....

Mapping Law
Different kinds of law
Agency law
Contract law
Tort Law
Securities Law

Miscellaneous 
Many different kinds of staking-
what could go wrong

Voting without knowledge of wrong doing

Code executed can be evil but code not executed is just text per se.

# NOTE: Brenden has included important point that weren't talked (much) during Live Session but wre tackled off-the-record in preparatory sessions. Make sure to include these in both SALIENT POINTS and full TAKEOUT.




# CHRIS META VIEWS

KEEP FOR SALIENT POINTS
At time this might all sound like “explain it to a five years-old”, but in our experience, a couple of things matter, in particular:
OUR OWN METHODOLOGY

-1- Here, we keep it simply useful to All, involved & invested reading this, i.e. actionable & implementable by All, toward next steps & goals ;

-2- While none of this is Legal Advice, nor may be construed as (an attempt at) Legal Practice, the ones in a position to expect from this some form of usefulness & utility include our friends at Publishing DAO, so we try & make it worth their while first, so it might work for us as well ;

-3- This should be useful too, as raw material for Major Tom reporting to Ground Control. Furthermore, bearing in mind some of the ulterior motives are educational, and also advising senior decision makers in various settings, it’s important to keep it intelligible, digestible & palatable ;

-4- We’ve all been through reading dense academic papers, forged by strikingly intelligent tunnel-vision people, with this inevitable question of  “SO WHAT?… does it imply in relation with the problem at hand & how can we use this anyway”: here we try to tame the troika of complexity, granularity, and guaranteed rabbit holes, while not losing sight of the larger picture, and ultimate usefulness & utility of this work & project ;

-5- This World’s quandary of silo-ed and fractured need-to-know processes & procedures, has all of us scrambling time & resources on cross-disciplinarian “stitching-babushka” efforts. While this may be partly due to the fact that knowledge & information are power & rent-seekers, our issues here might be best resolved by cracking disciplinarian dams, getting everyone to happily row & cruise on the same B/L/T/ drakkar.

-6- As we happily row, we might be able to further refine objectives & subsequent steps for retro-planning of next sessions & Fall deliverables.

This last legal hacking session was a masterful learning opportunity, beyond subject matter itself. Still smarting after a couple of days, we (Chris) put together the below remarks on main take-outs from various perspectives, using a full transcript. Leadership here means an ability to tackle complexity & granularity, hack it in smaller bits, and guide people through the process of building from the ground up, in ways that make these bits digestible, intelligible & useful for the purpose of AALE/DAOs. Be it business outcomes processes, laying the ground for a lawyer-client relationship, staying on track & focused on methodology & objectives, not getting swamped in complexity booby traps & rabbit holes, keeping it all packed up in an 85 minutes session while branching out for proper follow-up, etc.

Leadership crown definitely goes to Beth for hacking this performance, smashing complexity & picking up selected bits on a fast & furious tempo while keeping it all constructive & empathic enough so that our brains may fathom some mechanism design. Of course everyone did an amazing job: Dazza to keep us productively focused and on-track with a disciplined yet discerning application of legal frameworks ; Brenden’s legendary pluck to grab exactly what matters while keeping the fog away, and this uncanny ability to already foresee tomorrow’s next steps while making these sufficiently clear but still open enough so that we may further explore these options ; Bryan the indomitable mechanism engineer and more ; Silke for reasonably relevant points, some of which we emphasize below ; and last but not least, Cem & Jim who are really cool customers, being able to pivot from the entrepreneurial, business & technical daily experience of their DAO business toward a more legal framework-based approach, which is really a tough thing to do. Tremendous.

For anyone like us (Chris) still going through the motions, we kindly suggest you do the same below exercise: it will be time well used!
